--- Returns the first index of *element* in the given array-style table. If the table does not

--- Returns a new Lua table with the array and hash parts preallocated to accommodate *arrayCount*
--- and *hashCount* elements respectively.
---
--- If you can make a decent estimation of how big your table will need to be, `table.create()` can
--- be much more efficient than the alternative, especially in loops. For example, if you know your
--- array is always going to contain approximately ten elements, say `myArray = table.create( 10,

---@return table

--- `shallowcopy` returns a shallow copy of the *source* table. If a *destination* table is

---
--- [Inside Playdate: table.shallowcopy](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#t-table.shallowcopy)

---@param source table

function table.deepcopy(source) end

--- Returns two values, the current API version of the Playdate runtime and the minimum API version

function playdate.apiVersion() end

--- Implement this callback and Playdate OS will call it once per frame. This is the place
--- to put the main update-and-draw code for your game. Playdate will attempt to call
--- this function by default 30 times per second; that value can be changed by calling
--- playdate.display.setRefreshRate().
---
--- If your `update()` function takes too long to execute, Playdate OS may not be able to call it
--- as often as specified by the current refresh rate. In this case, Playdate OS will simply try
--- and call it as often as it can, with a not-to-exceed rate of playdate.display.getRefreshRate()
--- frames per second.
---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.update](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#c-update)
---@return nil
function playdate.update() end

--- Suspends callbacks to `playdate.update()` for the specified number of milliseconds.
---
--- `playdate.wait()` is ideal for pausing game execution to, for example, show a message to the
--- player. Because `.update()` will not be called, the screen will freeze during `.wait()`. Audio
--- will continue to play. Animation during this wait period is possible, but you will need to
--- explicitly call `playdate.display.flush()` once per frame.
---
--- While timers should pause during `playdate.wait()` (assuming `playdate.timer.updateTimers()`
--- and `playdate.frameTimer.updateTimers()` are invoked during `playdate.update()`), animators will
--- *not* pause during `playdate.wait()`. Be sure to account for this in your code.
---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.wait](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#f-wait)
---@param milliseconds integer
---@return nil
function playdate.wait(milliseconds) end

--- Stops per-frame callbacks to playdate.update(). Useful in conjunction with
--- playdate.display.flush() if your program only does things in response to button presses.
---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.stop](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#f-stop)

function playdate.start() end

--- Reinitializes the Playdate runtime and restarts the currently running game. The optional string
--- `arg` passed in is available after restart in playdate.argv as if it had been passed in on the
--- command line when launching the simulator.
---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.restart](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#f-restart)
---@param arg? string[]

---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.gameWillTerminate](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#c-gameWillTerminate)
---@return nil

---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.deviceWillSleep](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#c-deviceWillSleep)
---@return nil
function playdate.deviceWillSleep() end

--- If your game is running on the Playdate when the device is locked, this function will be called.
--- Implementing this function allows your game to take special action when the Playdate is locked,
--- e.g., saving state.
---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.deviceWillLock](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#c-deviceWillLock)
---@return nil
function playdate.deviceWillLock() end

--- If your game is running on the Playdate when the device is unlocked, this function will be
--- called.
---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.deviceDidUnlock](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#c-deviceDidUnlock)
---@return nil
function playdate.deviceDidUnlock() end

--- Called before the system pauses the game. (In the current version of Playdate OS, this only
--- happens when the device’s Menu button is pushed.) Implementing these functions allows your game
--- to take special action when it is paused, e.g., updating the menu image.
---
--- [Inside Playdate: playdate.gameWillPause](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html#c-gameWillPause)
---@return nil
function playdate.gameWillPause() end

--- depending upon the direction of rotation.
---
--- For example, say you have a movie player and you want your movie to advance 6 frames for every
--- one revolution of the crank. Calling `playdate.getCrankTicks(6)` during each update will give
--- you a return value of 1 as the crank turns past each 60 degree increment. (Since we passed in

---
--- For example, if you have a tilemap describing terrain, where tile ID 1 represents grass the

--- A callback that can be defined on a sprite to control the type of collision response that should
--- happen when a collision with *other* occurs. This callback should return one of the following
--- four values:
---
--- * playdate.graphics.sprite.kCollisionTypeSlide: Use for collisions that should slide over other objects, like Super Mario does over a platform or the ground.
--- * playdate.graphics.sprite.kCollisionTypeFreeze: Use for collisions where the sprite should stop moving as soon as it collides with other, such as an arrow hitting a wall.
--- * playdate.graphics.sprite.kCollisionTypeOverlap: Use for collisions in which you want to know about the collision but it should not impact the movement of the sprite, such as when collecting a coin.
--- * playdate.graphics.sprite.kCollisionTypeBounce: Use when the sprite should move away from
--- other, like the ball in Pong or Arkanoid.
---
--- The strings "slide", "freeze", "overlap", and "bounce" can be used instead of the constants.
---
--- Feel free to return different values based on the value of *other*. For example, if *other* is
--- a wall sprite, you may want to return "slide" or "bounce", but if it’s a coin you might return
--- "overlap".
---
--- If the callback is not present, or returns nil, *kCollisionTypeFreeze* is used.
---
--- Instead of defining a callback, the collisionResponse property of a sprite can be set directly
--- to one of the four collision response types. This will be faster, as the lua function will not
--- need to be called, but does not allow for dynamic behavior.
---
--- This method should not attempt to modify the sprites in any way. While it might be tempting to
--- deal with collisions here, doing so will have unexpected and undesirable results. Instead, this
--- function should return one of the collision response values as quickly as possible. If sprites
--- need to be modified as the result of a collision, do so elsewhere, such as by inspecting the

---
--- **Escaping styling characters**
---
--- To draw an asterisk or underscore, use a double-asterisk or double-underscore. Styles may not be
--- nested, but double-characters can be used inside of a styled portion of text.
---
--- For a complete set of characters allowed in *text*, see playdate.graphics.font. In addition, the
